# TestTask

Regarding the test task description it was not very important to pay attention to the layout. 
So I checked the client's website, found that Angular material is used there and decided to use it too.
On page, you will find textarea where you can add JSON to config the form. Example is entered by default. 
It can be changed and the form will be updated automatically.
